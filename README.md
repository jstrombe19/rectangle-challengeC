# rectangle-challengeC


This is a simple C program to display the value of a rectangle's length, width, area, and perimeter based on the information defined in the main function. This does not allow user input, but is an exercise in performing simple calculations and displaying the output in the terminal, as well as displaying multiple values in a single printf function.
